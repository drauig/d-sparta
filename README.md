# D-SPARTA (Drauig Smart Patrol Technology Architecture)

D-SPARTA is an AI-enabled, data-driven border intelligence and monitoring system designed for phased deployment and institutional integration across ECOWAS member states.

D-SPARTA addresses a critical regional need: the absence of integrated, real-time border monitoring systems capable of supporting timely, data-informed decision making, and supporting joint interventions by immigration, security, and maritime agencies. Current regional systems remain fragmented, predominantly manual, and limited in predictive capability. This gap enables increased trafficking, irregular migration, illicit border crossings, piracy, pipeline vandalism, and cross-border criminal movement.
